What is Drone Racing?
=====================

Drone racing has been a growing hobby over the past few years where pilots race drones against each other. As a group of racing and
action sport enthusiasts, The Drone Racing League immediately connected with the experience of FPV flying after they tried it. The
experience is so intense, and surprisingly visceral, they believed there would be a growing demand to see the skills of some of the
worldâ€™s greatest drone pilots. DRL focused on finding iconic and complex venues to make the experience more engaging for viewers at homeand built out the technology to support the filming.
